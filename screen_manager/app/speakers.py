"""Where a media player plays, on a screen: the rows of its speaker menu and the inputs it may switch to.

Everything here is what Home Assistant says, read in the meaning Home Assistant gives it:

* `source` and `source_list` are a player's input source (media_player's docs). Sonos lists its TV input and its
  favourites there, a TV its HDMI ports. The screen offers those behind an input key, never as speakers.
  The one exception is an integration whose sources are the devices it plays on, as Home Assistant's Spotify
  integration documents for Spotify Connect (SOURCE_SPEAKERS): those names are speakers.
* A player that reports GROUPING plays together with others of its own integration (`media_player.join`,
  `media_player.unjoin`); `group_members` says who plays with it now. Home Assistant's own media dialog offers the
  players of the same integration that report GROUPING, and so does the menu.
* A speaker whose library holds a player's account plays that player's library: Home Assistant's Sonos integration
  lists a Spotify account in every Sonos's library once Spotify is linked (the folder's id is the account's
  config entry), and `play_media` on the Sonos plays a Spotify item. When Home Assistant lists it, it plays.

A Spotify tile that plays on such a speaker follows it (the target): Spotify does not report what a Sonos plays
through its own Spotify service, so the card shows the speaker's state and its keys act on the speaker until the
player plays itself again.
