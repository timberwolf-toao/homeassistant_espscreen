"""A media player's library on a screen (app 0.4.42, firmware 0.24.0): its folders, their covers, and a tap that plays.

Home Assistant is the source of everything here. The library is what `media_player.browse_media` answers, the action
and not the websocket command: the websocket refuses a player that reports no BROWSE_MEDIA at that moment, and Spotify
reports nothing but SELECT_SOURCE while it plays nowhere, which is exactly when someone opens the library to start
something. The action has no such check (media_player/services.py) and answers at rest too.

A screen never holds a content id. It asks for a folder by a short number (a token) and gets its items with numbers of
their own; this app keeps what each number stands for, per screen, and plays it when the screen taps one. That keeps
the messages small (a Spotify id is 38 characters) and leaves the two steps of a start from rest here, where they can
wait for Home Assistant:

1. A player that reports no PLAY_MEDIA cannot be told to play (Home Assistant refuses `play_media`); a Spotify Connect
   account at rest is one. Choosing a speaker (`select_source`) wakes it: Spotify moves playback there, the integration
   reads its state again at once, and from then on it reports PLAY_MEDIA.
2. Then `play_media`, with the item's own content type and id, exactly as Home Assistant's media browser sends them.

Everything a player names is Home Assistant's: the folder titles (Spotify's are English, Home Assistant does not
translate them), the items, their classes and their thumbnails. Home Assistant hands out at most 48 items per folder
for Spotify (BROWSE_LIMIT) and says nothing of the rest; a screen shows what it gets, never more than LIMIT.
