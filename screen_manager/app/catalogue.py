"""The tile catalogue (app 0.4.32): what a tile of each entity type can do, and what a screen gets of it.

catalogue/*.yaml, one file per entity type, is the source; tools/generate_catalogue.py writes catalogue.json beside this
file, which is what this module reads. docs/CATALOGUE.md is the guide. Three questions, each answered here once:

- what may be chosen for an entity (`offers`): the options of its type whose `needs` its Home Assistant entity meets,
  the actions Home Assistant lists for it (get_services_for_target), their fields, its feature bits and its history;
- what a card of a given size draws (`resolve_controls`): the chosen control or the type's default, and on a card one
  row high what fits there (`one_row`);
- what a screen gets (`drawn_controls`): what that entity can draw (`fallback`) on that screen (`screen`, its hello).

And what a layout asks of a screen's firmware (`gates`), for core.min_firmware. The editor asks the same of
web/src/model/catalogue.ts, which reads the same file; tests/test_catalogue.py and its fixture keep the two alike.
