"""What Home Assistant says an entity can do (app 0.2.67).

Home Assistant describes each action with the entities it works on: its `target`, filtered by domain, integration,
device class and supported features. Since 2025.12 it also answers `get_services_for_target` with the actions that fit
one entity. ESP Screens asks it instead of keeping lists of its own, so a device or an integration that brings an action
works without an update: a cover gets On / off because Home Assistant lists `cover.toggle` for it, a speaker that cannot
turn on and off doesn't. `local_actions` gives the same answer from the action descriptions for an older Home Assistant.

What stays ours is which action each of our widgets sends, the tile catalogue (catalogue/*.yaml, catalogue.py): a small slider
on a light is `light.turn_on` with a brightness, so it only fits a light for which Home Assistant offers that field.
