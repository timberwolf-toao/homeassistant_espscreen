// A media player's library (firmware 0.24.0+, app 0.4.42+): its folders, a page of covers, and a tap that plays.
//
// Reached from the player's card: the round key at the top right, or the Library key a player at rest shows instead of
// its keys. The first level is what Home Assistant calls the player's media library (Spotify: Playlists, Artists,
// Albums, Liked songs, ...), drawn as cards with the icon of what each folder holds; a folder of things with pictures
// is a grid of covers with the title under each, two lines at most. A tap on something that plays plays it at once,
// on the speaker the player plays on (or, when it plays nowhere, the one chosen in the speaker menu that opens then);
// a folder that only opens, opens. Holding something that does both (an artist, a playlist) opens it instead.
//
// Nothing here knows a brand. The folders, their titles, their classes and their pictures are Home Assistant's,
// through ESP Screen Manager (screen_manager/app/media_library.py): the screen asks for a folder by a number and gets
// its items with numbers of their own; the app keeps what each number stands for and plays it when asked. A folder
// holds at most 48 items, what Home Assistant gives for Spotify, and the pager counts only those.
//
// The covers of a page come as one picture, the way a page's camera tiles do (tile_art): the screen names the frames,
// the app fills them with the thumbnails Home Assistant names and the corners rounded over the page, and every cell
// shows its own part. Nothing waits for it: the page is whole with its placeholders, and the picture comes over them.
//
// Like the effects page, the library is built when it opens and thrown away when it closes, so it costs nothing while
// closed. This header is the part a PC can test (tests/test_media_library.cpp): what a folder holds, how a page is
// laid out, the pager. media_library.cpp draws it, in a file of its own: main.cpp is near the reach of the S3's
// literal pool (page_receiver.cpp says why).
