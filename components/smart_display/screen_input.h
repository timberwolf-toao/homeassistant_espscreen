// ESPHome's touchscreen triggers: on_touch begins, on_update updates, on_release ends, because
// LVGL 9.5 sends no PRESSING to the input device. A touch that starts within `band` pixels of the
// left or right edge of the screen as the user sees it and travels `travel` pixels inward, more
// sideways than up or down, flips one page: from the right edge leftwards is "next", from the left
// edge rightwards "previous". No speed requirement; a touch that starts in the middle never counts,
// so tapping and dragging on tiles cannot change the page by accident. Up from the bottom edge goes home and down
// from the top edge opens the settings page, over every card as well as the tiles (firmware 0.28.0+).
//
// Every point here is already in the screen's own coordinates: `runtime_tiles::touch_input` turns a
// touchscreen's report with ESPHome's own `LvglComponent::rotate_coordinates`, the same call that
// places the pointer, so the board's quarter turn and the turn the user chose are both in it. This
// class used to redo that arithmetic from the display size the board declares, which is the canvas
// *after* the turn while ESPHome reports in the panel's own pixels: on a 800 x 1280 panel drawn as
// 1280 x 800 the right-hand band began at 772 instead of 1252, so two fifths of the glass turned a
