// The lock (firmware 0.5.0+): a Home Assistant lock entity as a tile and a card, the way Home Assistant's own lock
// dialog does it. Pure logic only, free of LVGL, so tests/test_lock_panel.cpp checks it on a PC: the colours and icons,
// what a tap on the tile does, which keys the card offers, when a code is asked for and how long a "tap again" waits.
// runtime_tiles.h draws it; the keypad and its lock after wrong codes are the alarm panel's (alarm_panel.h).
//
// What Home Assistant does, which this follows:
// - The states are locked, unlocked, locking, unlocking, open, opening and jammed (LockState). The actions are
//   lock.lock, lock.unlock and lock.open; open exists only where supported_features has OPEN (1), the latch that lets
//   the door swing. There is no lock.toggle.
// - Colours (--state-lock-*-color): locked green, the three moments in between orange, unlocked, open and jammed red.
//   Icons (icons.json of lock): lock, lock-open-variant, lock-clock while it moves, lock-alert when jammed.
// - A code is asked for (callProtectedLockService) when the lock has a code_format and no default code in its registry
//   options, for every one of the three actions: Home Assistant fills a default code in itself. The add-on says
//   whether one is stored; the code never leaves Home Assistant. Only digits are offered, as on the alarm's keypad.
// - Opening the door takes a second tap: the key says "Really open?" for five seconds (CONFIRM_TIMEOUT_SECOND in
//   more-info-lock.ts). The screen asks the same for unlocking, which Home Assistant's dialog does in one tap: a wall
//   screen is touched by everyone who walks past, so one stray tap never unlocks a door here.
// - Locking never asks: it is the safe way round, as every voice assistant Home Assistant bridges treats it (Google
//   asks its PIN to unlock, never to lock). A lock whose state the screen does not know is never unlocked.
//
// A tile decides for itself how far it may go (the `guard` option, per tile and so per screen): "confirm", the
// default, unlocks after a second tap; "lock_only" never unlocks or opens from this screen, for a screen in a porch,
// a garage or a child's room.
