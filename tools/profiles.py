"""The board profiles as the tests and tools read them (app 0.2.84+, packages layered since app 0.2.127).

A screen is an entry (`checkout/cyd.yaml` or `packages/cyd.yaml` for a CYD, `checkout/guition.yaml` or
`packages/guition.yaml` for a Guition, ...) that includes `packages/core.yaml`, which every board shares, and the
board's own file under `packages/boards/`. The board file includes packages of its own in turn: the cards of its grid
(`packages/cells/`), its look (`packages/looks/`) and its features (`packages/features/`). docs/PROFILES.md says how.

`files(name)` is that whole chain, `text(name)` all of it one file after the other, so a check that looks for a line
finds it wherever it lives. `substitutions(name)` is every `${NAME}` the chain defines, with the precedence ESPHome
gives them (the entry over the board over the board's own packages over the core) and worked out the way ESPHome
works them out (Jinja, for the sizes a look computes). `resolved(name)` is `text(name)` with those filled in, for a
check that needs the numbers or the whole lambda. None of this is what ESPHome builds: that is the merge ESPHome's
packages component makes; the firmware check in tools/check.sh compiles the real thing.
