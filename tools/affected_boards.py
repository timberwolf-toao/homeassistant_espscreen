"""Which boards a change reaches, and what its release is (app 0.3.21; docs/BOARD_RELEASES.md is the recipe).

A screen's firmware is built from packages/core.yaml plus its board file's chain (tools/profiles.py), the components
under components/, the fonts, and the `screen` section of screen_manager/translations. This compares the working tree
(committed, staged, unstaged and new files) with a base, by default where HEAD left origin/main, and sorts every
changed path:

- a file in one board's chain only (its board file, its entry files, a feature or hardware file no other board
  includes) reaches that board;
- a component under components/ that only some boards load as a platform (the CYD's xpt2046) reaches the boards
  whose entry files name it (tools/generate_entries.py);
- the core, the rest of components/, fonts/, a translation's `screen` texts, or a package several boards include
  reaches all of them;
- anything else (the add-on, the editor, docs, tests, tools) is no firmware at all.

A board whose board file is not in the base yet is new: no screen runs it, so it needs no firmware number of its own and
its release is one of the app (the catalog grows); only the boards that already exist decide the firmware release.

    tools/affected_boards.py              what changed, which boards it reaches, and the release that follows
    tools/affected_boards.py --keys       only the board keys it reaches, space separated, empty for none
    tools/affected_boards.py --build-keys the boards a build needs: --keys, or every board when the build's own tools,
                                          entries, fixtures or ESPHome changed (tools/check.sh --affected, CI)
    tools/affected_boards.py --older-sample  what a change that reaches every board builds on the min_version ESPHome:
                                          the CYD, plus a board for each changed file the CYD does not build
    tools/affected_boards.py --verify     whether every board it reaches builds a higher firmware number
    tools/affected_boards.py --base REF   compare with REF instead

Any error exits non-zero with nothing on stdout, so a caller never reads a crash as "no boards".

Standard library and PyYAML only.
