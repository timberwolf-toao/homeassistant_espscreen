"""Write screen_manager/app/boards.json: what every board looks like, straight from its own YAML.

A board says what its panel is (PANEL_W, PANEL_H, the pixels the glass really has), which LVGL angle lays
that panel out lying down (ROTATION_LANDSCAPE), how a page is divided each way (GRID_COLS x GRID_ROWS lying down,
GRID_COLS_PORTRAIT x GRID_ROWS_PORTRAIT standing up), its density and its look. The manager needs the same numbers
to draw a screen in the editor before it has ever been flashed, so they are worked out here instead of typed a
second time; `--check` fails when the file is out of date, which tools/check.sh runs. A screen that is online
reports its own shape as well (firmware 0.2.80), and that one wins: it knows how it was built and turned.

Every board gets both orientations under `orientations`, and keeps the landscape numbers at the top level, so
everything that only ever knew one shape per board reads the same file as before.
